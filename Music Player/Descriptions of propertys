1 >> Filter Property in css
// The filter property defines visual effects (like blur and saturation) to an element (often <img>).

drop-shadow(h-shadow v-shadow blur spread color)	Applies a drop shadow effect to the image.

Possible values:
h-shadow - Required. Specifies a pixel value for the horizontal shadow. Negative values place the shadow to the left of the image.

v-shadow - Required. Specifies a pixel value for the vertical shadow. Negative values place the shadow above the image.

blur - Optional. This is the third value, and must be in pixels. Adds a blur effect to the shadow. A larger value will create more blur (the shadow becomes bigger and lighter). Negative values are not allowed. If no value is specified, 0 is used (the shadow's edge is sharp).

spread - Optional. This is the fourth value, and must be in pixels. Positive values will cause the shadow to expand and grow bigger, and negative values will cause the shadow to shrink. If not specified, it will be 0 (the shadow will be the same size as the element).
Note: Chrome, Safari and Opera, and maybe other browsers, do not support this 4th length; it will not render if added.

color - Optional. Adds a color to the shadow. If not specified, the color depends on the browser (often black).

An example of creating a red shadow, which is 8px big both horizontally and vertically, with a blur effect of 10px:

filter: drop-shadow(8px 8px 10px red);

Tip: This filter is similar to the box-shadow property.
